# [Magento Paytrace Plugin](https://merchantprotocol.com/the-paytrace-payment-gateway-extension/)

We're dedicated to providing store owners and developers with the tools necessary to launch successful retail stores.

## PayTrace

PayTrace is a Payment Gateway, much like Authorize.net is a Payment Gateway, but PayTrace has differentiated itself from the pack by offering a more robust API. One of the most notable enhancements that you'll receive through the PayTrace API is [Level 3 Processing](https://merchantprotocol.com/knowledgebase/what-is-level-3-credit-card-processing/).

To use a Payment Gateway you must first have a [Merchant Account](https://merchantprotocol.com/merchant-accounts-and-merchant-services/).
